# Set to the URL of the load balancer for the MinIO deployment

# You use this below to environment variables to help bootstrap your cluster

# Set the hosts and volumes MinIO uses at startup
# The command uses MinIO expansion notation {x...y} to denote a
# sequential series.
#
# The following example covers four MinIO hosts
# with 4 drives each at the specified hostname and drive locations.
# The command includes the port that each MinIO server listens on
# (default 9000)
# MINIO_VOLUMES="https://minio{1...4}.example.net:9000/mnt/disk{1...4}/minio"

# Set all MinIO server options
#
# The following explicitly sets the MinIO Console listen address to
# port 9001 on all network interfaces. The default behavior is dynamic
# port selection.
# MINIO_OPTS="--console-address :9001"

# Example docker-compose.custom.yml
